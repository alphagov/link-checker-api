## Nomenclature

- **Link**: The consideration of a URI and all resulting redirects that may occur from it.
- **Check**: The process of taking a URI and checking it as a Link for any problems that may affecting linking to it within content.
- **Batch**: The functionality to check multiple URIs in a grouping.
