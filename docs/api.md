# Link Checker API's API

This documents the means to interface with the Link Checker API. This can be
done through HTTP Endpoints and webhooks. These methods will respond/send
specific entities.

## Endpoints

- [`GET /check`](#get-check)
- [`POST /batch`](#post-batch)
- [`GET /batch/:id`](#get-batchid)

## Webhook

- [Batch complete webhook](#batch-complete-webhook)

## Entities

- [`LinkReport`](#linkreport-entity)
- [`BatchReport`](#batchreport-entity)

## `GET /check`

<details>
  <summary>Example usage</summary>

```
$ curl -s http://link-checker-api.dev.gov.uk/check\?uri\=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gov.uk%2F | jq
{
  "uri": "https://www.gov.uk/",
  "status": "pending",
  "checked": null,
  "errors": [],
  "warnings": [],
  "danger": [],
  "problem_summary": null,
  "suggested_fix": null
}
```

```
$ curl -s http://link-checker-api.dev.gov.uk/check\?uri\=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gov.uk%2F\&synchronous\=true | jq
{
  "uri": "https://www.gov.uk/",
  "status": "ok",
  "checked": "2017-04-12T18:47:16Z",
  "errors": [],
  "warnings": [],
  "danger": [],
  "problem_summary": null,
  "suggested_fix": null
}
```

</details>

This endpoint is used to check a single link. If the link has been checked
within a time specified (default 4 hours) it will return the results from
that check, otherwise it will queue a check and return a pending report. You
can force it to return a completed check with the `synchronous` parameter.

### Query string attributes

- `uri` *(required)*
  - The URI to the link to be checked
- `checked_within` *(optional, defaults to 14400)*
  - An integer value of the number of seconds in the past that checks for this
    link are valid.
  - Use 0 to ensure the link is checked again
- `synchronous` *(optional, defaults to false)*
  - A boolean value to specify to check the URI during this request, this may
    cause a slow/timeout response, use with caution.

### Returns

A [`LinkReport`](#linkreport-entity)

## `POST /batch`

This endpoint is used to check a collection of links, such as those from a
webpage. It will create a resource that can be checked to get the status of
the batch, as well as return the resource in the response of this request.

### JSON Attributes

- `uris` *(required)*
  - An array of URIs to be checked (max length: 5000)
- `checked_within` *(optional, defaults to 14400)*
  - An integer value of the number of seconds in the past that checks for links
    are valid.
  - Use 0 to ensure links are all checked again
- `priority` *(optional, defaults to high)*
  - A value of "high" or "low" to indicate the priority of your job
  - If you are running a lots of batches you should set this to "low" so that
    you don't block usage for in app usage.
- `webhook_uri` *(optional)*
  - A URL that will be requested once the batch is complete.
- `webhook_secret_token` *(optional)*
  - A token that will be used to generate a [HMAC-SHA1][hmac-sha1] token that
    is included with the webhook for validating the origin.

### Returns

A [`BatchReport`](#batchreport-entity), status code will be 202 for an in-progress
BatchReport and 201 for a completed one.

## `GET /batch/:id`

  "completed_at": "2017-04-12T18:55:29Z"
}
```

</details>

This endpoint is used to check on the progress of a batch or to access
a completed batch

### Path Parameters

- `id` *(required)*
  - The id of a batch created via [`POST /batch`](#post-batch)

### Returns

A [`BatchReport`](#batchreport-entity)

## Batch complete webhook

You can specify a `webhook_uri` to [`POST /batch`](#post-batch) to receive a
callback when a batch is completed. This URL will receive a
`BatchReport`(#batchreport-entity) in a JSON POST request.

To use it you will need an endpoint available in your application that is
accessible without authentication and can receive POST requests.

### Verifying the webhook request

If you specified a `webhook_secret_token` when calling
[`POST /batch`](#post-batch) you will receive an additional header with the
webhook request of `X-LinkCheckerApi-Signature`. The value of this will be
a [HMAC-SHA1][hmac-sha1] signature that can be used to verify the request.

You can create one in a Rails application, using the raw JSON as the
`request_body`:

```
OpenSSL::HMAC.hexdigest(OpenSSL::Digest.new("sha1"), secret_token, request_body)
```

And verify this matches the value in the header.
